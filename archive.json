      "body": "Hi. I propose to update the origin attribute handling. There are comments following for this update and also related thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that BGP speakers compliant to new RFC could live in a world where the attribute is absent at all. But they should be able to interoperate with legacy speakers for now. We might need request an option to be able to turn off adding of the attribute.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I understand, RFC7606 7.1 rules handling of malformed attribute - for example with bad length. It seems that it not good idea to accept such malformed attributes.\r\n\r\nNext question I have is \"undefined value\" of the attribute - it is actually not quite obvious what that means, I haven't found a definition of it yet. It could be either an absent attribute, or an attribute with the value out of scope of defined values (or even both options). I also suggest to further specify what \"undefined value\" (I prefer the second option). It also seems sensible to include the warning for using undefined values in security section, because those could cause undefined behaviour in legacy BGP speakers.",

Maybe it should be given in such way, that the speaker SHOULD (or MUST) add ORIGING by default, but there MUST be a configuration knob to switch that behaviour.",

If we start passing something bad to it, it could break.\r\n\r\nBut current definition states that if we accept such announce, we rewrite it to 0, so there should not be \"transitive\" problems because of that. But there can be other class of problems when routes currently treated as withdrawn would be considered normal. All that of course requires some specific situations and configuration, but who know what lives there in the wild.\r\n\r\nOnly thing that concerns me, that we equalize here broken (invalid lenght), unspecified values (other than 0,1,2), and absent attribute. Sounds like they need to be treated the same way, when I would allow them to be treated differently. IMHO, I would kept broken as forbidden, would legitimized unspecified for internal usage, and would legitimized absent.",
