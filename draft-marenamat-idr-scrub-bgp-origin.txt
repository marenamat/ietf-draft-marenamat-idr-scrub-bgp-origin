                     Scrubbing BGP ORIGIN Attribute
              draft-marenamat-idr-scrub-bgp-origin-latest

Abstract

   The BGP Origin attribute in its original meaning has been out of use
   for years.  Yet, the BGP Origin attribute has high priority in the
   best route selection algorithm, right after the AS Path length, and
   it's being used inconsistently over the Internet to manipulate the
   route preference.

   This document updates RFC 4271 by making the BGP Origin attribute
   half-optional and explicitly allowing its scrubbing to zero (IGP).

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Tolerance of missing or malformed BGP Origin attribute

   Unless explicitly configured by a network operator to do otherwise,
   if the ORIGIN attribute has an undefined value, BGP speakers SHOULD
   replace it by a value of 0 (IGP).

   BGP speakers SHOULD NOT generate UPDATE Message Errors with the
   subcode 6, Invalid ORIGIN Attribute.

   Per the above specification, this document updates Section 4.5 of
   [RFC4271] by accepting routes without the ORIGIN attribute.

4.  Update to the BGP Origin attribute values

   The values of the BGP Origin attributed are originally specified in
   Section 4.3 of [RFC4271], the Path attribute part, a) ORIGIN (Type
   Code 1).

   Unless explicitly configured by a network operator to do otherwise,
   BGP speakers MUST NOT advertise BGP UPDATE messages with the ORIGIN
   attribute containing any other value than 0 (IGP), including manually
   configured static routes.

   Additionally, BGP speakers MAY rewrite any ORIGIN attribute value to
   0 (IGP) if they contain any other value.

   Per the above specification, this document updates Section 4.3 of
   [RFC4271] by deprecating ORIGIN attribute values 1 (EGP) and 2
   (INCOMPLETE), and Section 5.1.1 of [RFC4271].

5.  Security Considerations

6.  IANA Considerations
